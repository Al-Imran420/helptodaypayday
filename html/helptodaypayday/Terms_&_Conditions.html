Participating lenders who receive your application information from HelpTodayPayday.com review your information in real-time to determine whether your information meets the lender's loan qualification criteria.

By submitting the application form(s), you agree to allow participating lenders to review, verify, and research your information in such manner.
If a participating lender determines that your application meets its loan qualification criteria, the HelpTodayPayday.com web site will open a new web page identifying the name(s) and contact information of the lender(s), or redirect your browser to the lender's web site. You understand and agree that, once you have been redirected to the lender's web site, HelpTodayPayday.com has no further involvement in the loan application or approval process. Your subsequent interactions with the lender are subject to privacy policy, terms of use, and other policies and/or terms enforced by that lender.
